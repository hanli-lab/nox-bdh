+ 01eq: stage 1 for equilibrating 200 ps where taking all C$_{\alpha}$ atoms of protein and heavy atom of NMNH and FAD fixed;
+ 02npt: stage 2 for relaxing 10 ns where constraint applied to C$_{\alpha}$ atoms of protein and heavy atom of NMNH and FAD decreasing from 100 to 0 kcal/mol/ang^2 at an inteveral of 2 ns;
+ 03prod: stage 3 for production lasting 100 ns with removing all constraints;
